# ArrayLSTM
Pytorch implementation of [Recurrent Memory Array Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03085) by Kamil M Rocki. This code was implemented as part of the [TODO](TODO) paper. We ask people to [cite](#References) both works when using the software for academic research papers.

## Documentation
We provide an extensive documentation including installation instructions and reference at [array-lstm.readthedocs.io](https://array-lstm.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
